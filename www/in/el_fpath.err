ERRORS
   EINVAL
      Input parameter is NULL

   ENAMETOOLONG
      File name is too long

   Function can also fail and set *errno* for any of the errors
   specified for the routing **fopen**\ (3)

If function fails with **EINVAL** or **ENAMETOOLONG**, file is not
opened and any calls that logs to file will result in failure. Any
other error is in reality just a warning, meaning file could not have
been opened now, but embedlog will try to reopen in each time it logs
to file. **EINVAL** and **ENAMETOOLONG** are unrecovery errors, and
embedlog will never store any log in that situation.
