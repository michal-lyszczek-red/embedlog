NAME
----
**el_flush**, **el_oflush** - flush logs from all buffers to underlying
devices.

SYNOPSIS
--------
.. code-block:: c

   include <embedlog.h>

   int el_flush(void)

   int el_oflush(struct el *el)

DESCRIPTION
-----------
**embedlog** (and underlying drivers, operating systems, libraries etc)
to improve performance, may buffer message before commiting changes to
actual device. And it's ok, there is really no need to waste resources
every time you want to log 50 bytes of debug print on commiting message
physically to the drive - or send via network. It's much more common to
buffer messages in RAM until certain amount of bytes are ready to send
- and then send a bunch of data in one quick burst. But that behaviour
is not always desired, like in situation in which we know we won't be
printing logs for long time. For such situation explicit flush may in
order.

|el_flush| flushes logs from all buffers to underlying device.
For example, when logs are printed to file, logs are written through
buffered **stdio** functions, which may result in some logs never being
actually put into block device in case of abnormal application crash.
This function will do everything what is in its power to make sure logs
landed on underlying device. This applies to files, but also to logs
with network output.

|el_oflush| works just the same, but accepts custom *el* object
as argument.

RETURN VALUE
------------
Functions return 0 upon successful flush or -1 on errors. When -1 was
returned there is no guarantee that data has landed on underlying
device.

ERRORS
------
|el_flush| and |el_oflush| may return errors from
functions like: **fflush**, **fileno**, **fsync**,
**fseek**, **ftell**, **fopen** and/or **fclose**.

|el_oflush| may additionally return:

**EINVAL**
   Passed el object is not valid
