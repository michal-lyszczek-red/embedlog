NAME
-----
**el_cleanup** - cleans all resources allocated by |el_init| and
|el_option| calls.
**el_destroy** - cleans all resurces allocated by |el_new|.

SYNOPSIS
--------
.. code-block:: c

   include <embedlog.h>

   int el_cleanup(void)
   int el_ocleanup(struct el *el)
   int el_destroy(struct el *el)

DESCRIPTION
-----------
|el_cleanup| flushes all remaining buffers and frees any
resources allocated through the life of the library. After clean up,
library calls cannot be used without initialization.

|el_ocleanup| works just the same, but accepts custom *el* object
as argument.

|el_destroy| works just the same, but must be used when *el*
object has been created with |el_new| function.

RETURN VALUE
------------
Functions return 0 upon successful cleanup or -1 on errors. When -1 was
returned no resources were freed, and library functions still can be
used.

ERRORS
------
|el_cleanup| function cannot fail. |el_ocleanup| and
|el_destroy| may return:

EINVAL
   Passed el object is not valid
