If this is set to 1, output will be enriched with ANSI colors
depending on the message severity. This option needs terminal
supporting colors. You can store messages with colors to file, and
then read them with colors on color-enabled terminal. If this is set
to 0, no colors will be added. If you read file with colors in editor
like **vim**, you will see control characters all over file.
