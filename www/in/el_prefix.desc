You can configure logger to add *prefix* to every message you print.
*prefix* will be printed between log level info "i/" and you message.
No spaces are added. If you set your *prefix* to simple **PREFIX**,
printed message will be **i/PREFIXmy log message**, so you might want
to add space there. If *prefix* is bigger than **EL_PREFIX_LEN**
prefix will be truncated. To disable prefixing, simply set *prefix*
to **NULL**.
