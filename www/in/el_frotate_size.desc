*size* defines file size at which files will be rotated. If message being
printed would overflow rotate size, current file will be closed and
new one will be created, and current message will be stored in that
new file. It is guaranteed that file will not be bigger than value
set in this option. If log printed into file is bigger than configure
rotate size, message will be truncated, to prevent file bigger than
configure rotate size. It's very rare situation as it doesn't make a
lot of sense to set rotate size to such small value.
